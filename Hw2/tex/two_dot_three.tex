\paragraph{a.1}
It is not necessary, because the result will always be the same. Therefore we can fix the action of the computer if it is the first player. This will allows to reduce the excution time.
\paragraph{a.2}
If the computer is the first player, we can use heuristics such as
\begin{enumerate}
\item Play middle (action 4)
\item Play corner (actions 0,2,6 and 8)
\end{enumerate}
To maximizes the fun, we randomize which of these actions is chosen.
\paragraph{a.3}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Computer plays "corner" when the player has played middle
\item Computer plays "middle" when the player has played corner
\end{enumerate}
